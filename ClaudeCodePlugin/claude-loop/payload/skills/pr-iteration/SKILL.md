name: pr-iteration
description: The playbook for opening, updating, and iterating on a pull request until it is mergeable. Use this whenever you open a PR, respond to CI failures, respond to automated or human review comments, rebase a branch, or are asked to "babysit", "fix", or "get a PR green". Applies in interactive sessions, subagents, and routines alike.

# PR iteration loop

Goal state (all must be true before you declare done):
1. A **ready-for-review** PR exists (NOT draft — external reviewers skip drafts) and links its issue (`Closes #N`). `gh pr create` without `--draft`; if a PR somehow exists as draft, promote it with `gh pr ready`.
2. All CI checks are green.
3. Every review comment — including from automated reviewers like Codex — is fixed (commit reference), answered (reasoned reply), or acknowledged (👍 reaction). None ignored.
3b. Never busy-poll and never use fixed sleeps for CI. Use the waiting strategy below.

## Waiting strategy

The single routine or interactive session owns the PR until it converges or
escalates. Strategy order for waiting:
   1. PRIMARY — SUBSCRIBE, if this session has PR-subscription/notification tools: subscribe to the PR's activity (CI results, review comments) and react to each event as it arrives. ALWAYS pair the subscription with a backstop check-in of AT MOST 5 minutes — subscriptions can drop events, and an unattended session that trusts one completely can wait forever. On each backstop wake-up with no events: verify actual PR state before going back to waiting (the event you're waiting for may have been dropped).
   2. If no subscription capability exists: the blocking watch below — it wakes the instant CI completes.
   3. If the blocking watch is unavailable or gets killed: scheduled check-ins alone, interval AT MOST 5 minutes.
   Rule for ANY check-in interval: keep it at most 5 minutes even when Xcode Cloud or automated review is slow. A one-hour check-in is a bug, not patience.

Waiting is done with BLOCKING commands, which cost no tokens and wake the instant something completes:
   - CI: `gh pr checks <pr> --watch --interval 30` — returns when all checks finish. This is the in-session subscription; there is no fixed sleep to tune and CI duration doesn't matter.
   - ZERO CHECKS IS NEVER GREEN. External CI systems (Xcode Cloud, etc.) can take 1-3 minutes to REGISTER after a push. First detect whether the preserved per-repo script supports CI listing with `grep -q -- '--list-ci-checks)' .claude/scripts/checks.sh`. If supported, read the exact required context names from `.claude/scripts/checks.sh --list-ci-checks`; when that list is nonempty, retry `gh pr checks <pr> --json name` every 60s for up to 5 minutes until EVERY configured name is present. One early provider is not sufficient. If the script is from an older scaffold or the configured list is empty, use the single-provider fallback and wait until at least one check registers. Only then start the watch. If the expected set never appears, escalate ("Expected CI checks never registered: ..."), do not declare success.
   - External reviewers (Codex etc.): apply this protocol independently for every head SHA. A submitted review for the current head completes the external-review gate. On the exact `@codex review` request for this head, a 👀 reaction from `chatgpt-codex-connector[bot]` means only "accepted/in progress"; a 👍 from that bot means "completed with no findings" and passes the gate.
     1. If neither completed signal exists 20 minutes after the CURRENT head was pushed, post a PR comment containing exactly `@codex review`. ONCE per head SHA — never repeat for the same head.
     2. Stay subscribed. If 60 minutes pass after that request without either a Codex-bot 👍 or a submitted review, escalate for human intervention: report the head SHA, CI state, request time, and missing review signal on the PR and linked issue, then replace `claude-running` with `claude-blocked`. Do not proceed on internal review alone.
     Do not count 👀, your own request comment, or reactions from other actors as completed review. Never reply to the request comment. A new push resets both deadlines.
   - Guard the watch: if the environment kills long-blocking calls, fall back to `sleep 120` + `gh pr checks` in a loop, still capped by this skill's iteration limits.

4. The PR description contains evidence per `.claude/rules/git.md`.

## Loop procedure

Track an iteration counter. **Hard cap: 8 iterations.** On hitting the cap, or on the same check failing 3 times in a row, stop and escalate (see below).

1. **Snapshot state against the current head:**
   - `HEAD_SHA=$(gh pr view <pr> --json headRefOid --jq .headRefOid)` — record it.
   - `gh pr checks <pr>` (interactive sessions may use `--watch`; routines poll with sleep, don't spin).
     Checks count only if they are COMPLETED (not queued/in-progress) and apply to $HEAD_SHA.
   - `gh pr view <pr> --comments` and `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<pr>/comments` for review threads.
1b. **Triage every comment before acting.** Classify each as: actionable current defect / already fixed / outdated (on a superseded commit) / duplicate / non-blocking suggestion / human or product decision / bot status chatter / my own prior reply. ONLY "actionable current defect" triggers code changes. Acknowledgment protocol — react, don't reply:
   - Reviewed, nothing to do (non-actionable, already fixed, outdated, bot status, agree-but-non-blocking): add a 👍 reaction to that comment. `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/comments/<id>/reactions -f content='+1'` (inline review comments) or `.../issues/comments/<id>/reactions` (PR conversation comments). A reaction proves the comment was seen without creating thread noise, and nothing re-triggers on reactions — no reply loops.
   - Fixed: reply with the commit SHA (text, because the reference matters).
   - Disagree on substance: one reasoned reply, then stop — do not debate a bot across multiple turns; escalate if it blocks required checks.
   - Never reply to your own comments.
2. **Diagnose before touching code:**
   - For a failed check: `gh run view <run-id> --log-failed`. Read the actual error. Reproduce locally with `.claude/scripts/checks.sh` before attempting a fix.
   - Distinguish: my code broke it / flaky test / broken main / infra failure. Only the first is yours to fix by editing code.
3. **Fix the root cause, minimally.** Obey `.claude/rules/simplicity.md` and `.claude/rules/testing.md`. Never edit tests to get green.
4. **Verify locally** with `.claude/scripts/checks.sh` and capture output.
5. **Commit + push.** One coherent batch per iteration: group findings that share a cause; don't mix unrelated repairs, and don't make one commit per nitpick. Message format: `fix(ci): <what> — iteration <n>`.
6. **Close the loop on review comments**: fixed ones get a reply with the commit SHA; everything else you processed gets a 👍 reaction per the acknowledgment protocol in 1b.
7. Return to step 1.

## Completion consistency check (MANDATORY before declaring done)

1. Re-read the head SHA: `gh pr view <pr> --json headRefOid --jq .headRefOid`.
2. If it differs from the $HEAD_SHA your status snapshot used, discard the snapshot and return to step 1 — green checks for a stale commit prove nothing.
3. For a stacked child (PR base is not the default branch), re-read
   `gh pr view <pr> --json baseRefName,baseRefOid`. If the parent PR heading
   that base branch has merged, merge the default branch into the child,
   retarget the PR's base to the default branch, and return to step 1. If it
   closed without merging, escalate instead of retargeting: a retargeted
   child would carry the abandoned parent's unmerged changes into the
   default branch, so a human must decide. If
   `baseRefOid` no longer matches the recorded parent head the evidence was
   collected against: when the recorded head is an ancestor of the new
   `baseRefOid` (a normal advance), merge the parent's new head into the
   branch, set the recorded parent head to that validated `baseRefOid`,
   post the authenticated
   `Stacked on #<p> at <sha>. <!-- claude-stack-base <sha> -->` marker for
   the newly integrated head, and
   return to step 1 — checks and reviews for the old merge result prove
   nothing. When it is not an ancestor, the parent's history was rewritten
   (rebased or force-pushed): never merge it — that would carry the
   rewrite's dropped commits into the child — escalate for a human decision
   instead.
4. Require: at least one check exists, and all REQUIRED checks completed successfully for the current head SHA, and the review-thread triage was performed against the current code. An empty check list fails this gate.
5. For a loop-managed PR linked with `Closes #N`: for a stacked child, first
   comment exactly
   `Ready with stack parent at <sha>. <!-- claude-stack-parent <sha> -->`
   on the issue, where `<sha>` is the `baseRefOid` just validated — the
   scheduled sweep compares it against the parent's current head, and the
   marker must exist before the label flips so an overlapping sweep never
   sees a ready child without one. For a PR whose base IS the default branch
   but whose issue carries an authenticated stack marker: first recover the
   parent PR from the newest stack marker's `Stacked on #<p>` text (or the
   child PR body) and verify that PR MERGED — a child retargeted by hand
   under an open or closed-unmerged parent may carry that parent's unmerged
   changes, so escalate instead of publishing ready. Only after a merged
   parent, comment exactly
   `Ready on the default branch. <!-- claude-stack-parent default -->`
   before the label flip, so the sweep stops re-dispatching it.
   Then replace `claude-running`
   with `claude-ready`, and verify the issue has exactly one state label and
   that it is `claude-ready` (not `claude-running` or `claude-blocked`).

## Escalation (cap hit, repeated failure, or genuinely stuck)

Post ONE comment on the PR containing: what fails, your diagnosis, what you tried (with commit refs), and your best hypothesis. Then find the linked issue from the PR's `Closes #N`, post an issue escalation containing the diagnosis, attempts, commit refs, and specific questions, and replace `claude-running` with `claude-blocked`. Verify the issue has exactly the blocked terminal label before stopping. A stalled loop with a good diagnosis and a blocked issue is a success condition, not a failure — burning iterations past the cap or leaving the issue running is the failure.

## Never

- Never merge, never push to main.
- Never respond to CI runs triggered by your own just-pushed commit as if they were new external feedback — wait for the run to finish, act once.
- Never disable, skip, or `continue-on-error` a CI check to get green.
