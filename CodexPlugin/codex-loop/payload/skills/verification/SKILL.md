description: How to verify work and prove it with evidence before claiming anything is done. Use this EVERY time you are about to say a task, fix, feature, or PR is complete, working, fixed, or passing — in interactive sessions, subagents, and routines. Also use when writing the Evidence section of a PR description.

# Verification

Core rule: **show evidence, don't assert success.** "Tests pass" is a claim; pasted test output is evidence. Every completion claim must be backed by the command you ran and what it returned.

## Standard verification

1. Run `.codex/scripts/checks.sh --clean` for pre-PR evidence (tool-native clean, then build/test/lint — incremental build state can mask failures). Plain `checks.sh` is fine for mid-iteration checks.
2. Paste the tail of its output (result lines, counts, timing) wherever you report completion — chat, PR description, or issue comment.
3. If any step was skipped (e.g., no simulator available in this environment), say so explicitly instead of implying full verification.
4. Exit 42 means the host itself cannot verify this project — `PLATFORM_CAN_VERIFY` failed and no step ran. That is not a pass and not a project failure: report the work as UNVERIFIED, paste the deferral lines as the evidence of what happened, and state that CI is the verifier. Never summarize a 42 as "checks passed".

## UI changes (apps, views, components)

Never report a UI change as complete based on a successful edit or build alone. Verify it the way a human reviewer would:
- Run the app / preview and exercise the changed flow, or
- If the environment can't run a UI, state exactly that: "Built successfully; visual verification not possible in this environment — needs a human look at <screen>."
- Include what you checked: states (empty/loading/error), light/dark, dynamic type if relevant.

## New behavior

- Point to the specific test(s) that cover it. The cleanest fail-before proof is test-first: write the test, run it, show the failure output, then implement. If the test was written after the code, checking out the parent commit in a THROWAWAY `git worktree` and running the test there is acceptable. Never use `git stash` for this in an automated tree — stash conflicts with untracked/generated files can corrupt in-progress work. If neither is safely reproducible, say the proof was skipped rather than faking it.

## PR completion claims

Before claiming a PR is done, apply the pr-iteration skill's completion consistency check: checks must be COMPLETED (not merely started) for the CURRENT head SHA — re-read the SHA after collecting status; if it changed, re-verify.

## Quantify wherever possible

Prefer checks that produce numbers or binary outcomes: N tests passed, 0 lint warnings, build succeeded in Ns. The more quantitative the check, the more trustworthy the self-verification.
